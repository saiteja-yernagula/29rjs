    why we need js
    1. dynamic web pages
    2. interactive web pages
    3. functionalities
    4. animations
    5. validations- form-- log in signup authentification


     
    
    usage of js
    webdevelopment
    mobile app development

    what is javascript 
    javascript is a high level programming language 
    that is used to create dynamic  and interactive web pages

    javascript terms
    lightweight
    croos platform
    highlevel
    single threaded
    intrepreted compiled - just intime compilation
    scripting language
    dynamically typed


    html and css- browser

    javascript- js engine --browser


    console.log(3+3)



    javascript run time environment
    callstack
    webapi
    callback que
    event loop

    synchronous code- which doesnt takes time

    asynchronous code- which takes time

/*
Create a simple JavaScript script that declares three different types of variables (var, let, and const) and prints their values to the console.
Create variables of different data types: number, string, boolean, undefined, null, object, array, and function
Use the typeof operator to log the type of each variable to the console



Write a JavaScript script that compares two variables using different comparison operators (==, ===, !=, !==, >, <, >=, <=) and prints the results.

Write a JavaScript script that uses the ternary operator to determine if a number is even or odd.

Expand the script to include a ternary operation that checks if a user is an adult (18+) or a minor.

Grade Classification: Declare a variable score and set it to a value between 0 and 100.
 Use nested ternary operators to classify the score into grades: A (>= 90), B (>= 75), C (>= 60), D (>= 45), and F (below 45). Log the grade.

 Temperature Check: Declare a variable temperature and 
 use nested ternary operators to categorize it as "Hot" (above 30)
 , "Warm" (20-30), "Cool" (10-19),
  and "Cold" (below 10). Log the result.

 Age Group: Declare a variable age and 
 use the ternary operator to classify the age into "Child" (0-12), "Teen" (13-19), "Adult" (20-64), and "Senior" (65 and above). Log the result.

Print the price.

Task 5: Simple Calculator
Scenario: You are developing a simple calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations.

Task:

Assume variables num1 and num2 hold two numbers, and operator holds the arithmetic operator as a string (e.g., “+”).
Use a switch case statement to perform the operation and store the result in a variable result.
Print the result.

















day 6

Instructions:
Use a for loop to multiplication the given 
Take prompt from the user
hint: take count value as 1;
5*4*3*2*1



(optional)
Task 4: Print the Alphabet
Scenario: Write JavaScript code that prints the alphabet from A to Z.
Instructions:
Use a for loop to iterate through the ASCII values of the letters A to Z.
Convert the ASCII values to characters and print them.
Hint - console.log(String.fromCharCode(i));
