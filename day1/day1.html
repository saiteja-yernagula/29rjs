    why we need js
    1. dynamic web pages
    2. interactive web pages
    3. functionalities
    4. animations
    5. validations- form-- log in signup authentification


     
    
    usage of js
    webdevelopment
    mobile app development

    what is javascript 
    javascript is a high level programming language 
    that is used to create dynamic  and interactive web pages

    javascript terms
    lightweight
    croos platform
    highlevel
    single threaded
    intrepreted compiled - just intime compilation
    scripting language
    dynamically typed


    html and css- browser

    javascript- js engine --browser


    console.log(3+3)



    javascript run time environment
    callstack
    webapi
    callback que
    event loop

    synchronous code- which doesnt takes time

    asynchronous code- which takes time
